  M5 INTEGRATES MATH + PORTUGUESE - UNIQUE EDUCATIONAL VALUE

  This module is pedagogically innovative but CONTENT-INTENSIVE.
  Cannot implement without complete problem bank and validation.

  CONTENT-FIRST APPROACH REQUIRED:
  1. Create problem bank (70 problems)
  2. Brazilian educator review
  3. Student keyword validation
  4. Cultural sensitivity check
  5. THEN implement technical system

  ESTIMATED CONTENT CREATION: ~40 hours
  - Problem writing: 20 hours (70 problems × 15-20 min each)
  - Educator review: 8 hours
  - Keyword validation: 4 hours
  - Cultural guidelines: 4 hours
  - Ambiguity testing: 4 hours

  Technical implementation: ~15 hours (simple after content ready)
