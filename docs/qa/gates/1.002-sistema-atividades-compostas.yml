  PLANNING STAGE ASSESSMENT

  This story builds critical multi-module orchestration on US-001 foundation.

  STRENGTHS:
  - Excellent component architecture (Orchestrator, Sequencer, Pipeline, Tracker) ✓
  - Clear acceptance criteria with Given-When-Then ✓
  - Comprehensive test coverage planned (35 scenarios) ✓
  - Strong risk awareness (8 risks identified, 2 critical) ✓
  - Good dependency awareness (US-001 blocking) ✓

  CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES:
  1. US-001 MUST pass quality gates before US-002 starts
     - State management must be proven stable
     - Error isolation must work correctly
     - Performance targets must be met
     - If US-001 has issues, US-002 will amplify them 3-5x

  MUST FIX BEFORE CODING:
  1. Verify US-001 gate status is PASS (dependency gate check)
  2. Create ADR-004: Activity State Management Architecture
     - State machine diagram with all transitions
     - Persistence strategy (localStorage + Supabase)
     - Conflict resolution rules (last-write-wins)
     - State validation on resume
  3. Add performance targets to story:
     - Orchestration overhead: <500ms
     - Transition time: <1s (including save)
     - Data pipeline transforms: <50ms
     - Multi-module memory: 3 modules <120MB, 5 modules <180MB
  4. Define inter-module data schemas and validation
  5. Create module compatibility matrix
  6. Quantify "smooth transitions" (DoD-9) as <1s + no flicker

  ESTIMATED PREP TIME: ~20 hours
  - US-001 dependency verification: 2 hours
  - State management architecture (ADR-004): 6 hours
  - Performance targets refinement: 2 hours
  - Data pipeline design: 4 hours
  - Module compatibility matrix: 2 hours
  - Test infrastructure setup (Supabase): 4 hours

  STATE MANAGEMENT IS CRITICAL:
  - This is the highest risk area (DATA-002, score 9)
  - Complex distributed state across multiple modules
  - Single source of truth in ActivityOrchestrator
  - Dual persistence (local + remote) required
  - State validation on every load/resume
  - Comprehensive testing (20+ state scenarios)

  Once prep items complete and US-001 verified, story is READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION.
