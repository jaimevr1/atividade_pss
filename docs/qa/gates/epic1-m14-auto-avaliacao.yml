  M14 IS PSYCHOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE - REQUIRES SPECIALIST INPUT

  This module collects sensitive self-perception data from children.
  Privacy and psychological safety are PARAMOUNT.

  SPECIALIST REVIEWS REQUIRED:
  - Educational psychologist (emotional safety)
  - Data privacy specialist (LGPD compliance)
  - Brazilian educator (cultural appropriateness)

  PRIVACY-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Student data never visible to peers
  - Teacher dashboard shows trends only, not raw responses
  - Parent/guardian consent for data collection
  - Data retention limits (delete after X months)

  ESTIMATED PREP: ~20 hours
  - Privacy architecture: 6 hours
  - Calibration algorithms: 4 hours
  - Emotional validation protocol: 4 hours
  - Teacher dashboard design: 4 hours
  - LGPD compliance: 2 hours

  PLUS: Specialist reviews (external dependency, timeline varies)
