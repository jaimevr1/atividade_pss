  PLANNING STAGE ASSESSMENT

  This story has excellent bones but needs specification refinement before coding begins.

  STRENGTHS:
  - Clear performance targets (<2s, <100ms, <50MB) ✓
  - Good component architecture (separation of concerns) ✓
  - Comprehensive test coverage planned (37 scenarios) ✓
  - Strong risk awareness (8 risks identified) ✓

  MUST FIX BEFORE CODING:
  1. Add AC-4 for security (JSON validation, XSS prevention)
  2. Add AC-5 for accessibility (WCAG AA, keyboard navigation)
  3. Refine vague ACs (define "correct state", "safe state", "friendly message")
  4. Create ADR-002 (state management strategy)
  5. Add schemaVersion to JSON schema
  6. Choose JSON validation library (Zod recommended)

  ESTIMATED PREP TIME: ~16 hours
  - Story refinement: 2 hours
  - Technical design (ADRs): 4 hours
  - Security review: 2 hours
  - Test infrastructure setup: 8 hours

  Once these items are addressed, story is READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION.
