  M1 IS THE FIRST CONCRETE EDUCATIONAL MODULE

  This module sets the pattern for all future educational modules.
  Quality here establishes the baseline for the entire platform.

  DEPENDENCIES:
  - US-001 (Runtime) must be PASS
  - US-003 (Feedback) should be in development

  CRITICAL: Problem generation quality directly impacts learning outcomes.
  Cannot compromise on educational appropriateness.

  ESTIMATED PREP: ~30 hours
  - Algorithms documentation: 8 hours
  - Problem templates: 12 hours
  - User testing protocol: 4 hours
  - Accessibility specs: 4 hours
  - BNCC validation: 2 hours
