  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Minimal attack surface - static message bank, no user input in feedback generation'

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Target <100ms defined but message selection complexity may challenge this'
    targets:
      - 'Feedback display: <100ms after response submission'
      - 'Animation duration: 600ms max'
      - 'Message selection: <50ms from bank'
    gaps:
      - 'Message caching strategy not defined'
      - 'Performance benchmarking not in test plan'

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Simple, stateless feedback generation - low reliability risk'

  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Message bank maintenance could become complex without good tooling'
    requirements:
      - 'Message bank versioning strategy'
      - 'A/B testing framework for message optimization'
      - 'Teacher configuration for feedback style'

  usability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Critical - pedagogical appropriateness and emotional impact must be validated'

  PLANNING STAGE ASSESSMENT - PEDAGOGICAL MODULE

  This story is unique in Epic 1 as it's primarily about CONTENT QUALITY and EMOTIONAL IMPACT,
  not just technical implementation.

  STRENGTHS:
  - Clear pedagogical principles (formative, not punitive) ✓
  - Specific performance target (<100ms) ✓
  - Emotional design considerations ✓
  - Examples provided for each feedback type ✓

  CRITICAL CONTENT GAPS:
  1. Message bank doesn't exist yet (only 4 examples in story)
  2. No pedagogical review process defined
  3. No emotional impact validation methodology
  4. Age-appropriateness criteria not quantified

  MUST CREATE BEFORE CODING:
  - Initial message bank (50+ messages minimum for MVP)
  - Emotional impact testing protocol
  - Brazilian educator review checklist
  - Message bank management tooling

  ESTIMATED PREP TIME: ~24 hours
  - Message bank creation: 12 hours
  - Educator review: 4 hours
  - Emotional testing protocol: 4 hours
  - Accessibility specs: 2 hours
  - Performance benchmarking: 2 hours

  This is a CONTENT-FIRST story. Technical implementation is straightforward,
  but content quality is CRITICAL to product success.
