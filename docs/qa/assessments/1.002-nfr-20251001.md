# NFR Assessment: Story 1.002 - Sistema de Atividades Compostas

Date: 2025-10-01
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

**Status**: PLANNING - NFR baseline for implementation

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - No new attack vectors beyond US-001
- **Performance**: CONCERNS - Multi-module orchestration targets needed
- **Reliability**: CONCERNS - Complex state management requires robust error handling
- **Maintainability**: PASS - Good architectural separation planned

**Quality Score**: 68/100 (Planning baseline)

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Security - PASS

**Status**: PASS (inherits from US-001)
**Target**: Secure activity configuration, data flow isolation, student data protection

#### Requirements Analysis

From story and dependencies:
- Activity configurations are JSON (same as US-001 modules)
- Inter-module data flow (new attack surface to consider)
- Student progress stored in Supabase
- Depends on US-001 security foundation

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Reuses US-001 ModuleValidator for activity configs
- Activity schema is structured, not user-generated code
- Data flow pipeline uses defined schemas
- Student data persistence uses Supabase (secured in US-005)

**New Attack Surfaces Identified**:
1. **Inter-module data injection**: Malicious module could inject data affecting next module
2. **Activity configuration tampering**: Modified dataFlow could route data incorrectly
3. **Progress data exposure**: Activity state contains student responses

**Security Requirements**:

**Must Implement**:
- Validate activity configuration schema (same rigor as module configs)
- Sanitize all data passed through DataPipeline
- Validate data flow configurations against module compatibility
- Encrypt student progress data at rest (Supabase RLS)
- Audit logging for activity state changes

**Should Implement**:
- Rate limiting on activity creation (future - teacher portal)
- Data flow schema versioning
- Module isolation (prevent cross-module data leaks)

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Activity schema validation tests
- [ ] Data pipeline injection attempt tests
- [ ] Inter-module data sanitization tests
- [ ] Student data encryption verification
- [ ] Activity tampering detection tests

**Recommendation**: Security framework from US-001 provides solid foundation. Add specific tests for data flow pipeline security.

### 2. Performance - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (targets defined but orchestration overhead not quantified)
**Targets**:
- Duration estimation accurate (±10%) ✓ (clearly defined)
- Smooth transitions between modules (needs quantification)
- Progress tracking overhead minimal (not defined)

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Duration estimation requirement is concrete (±10%)
- Story mentions "smooth transitions" (UX aware)
- Lazy loading implied by module architecture

**Gaps Identified**:
1. **No orchestration overhead target** - How much does ActivityOrchestrator add?
2. **Transition time not defined** - What is "smooth"? <500ms? <1s?
3. **Multi-module memory usage** - If 1 module = 50MB, what about 5 modules?
4. **Data pipeline transformation time** - How long for BateriaRápida → AutoAvaliação?
5. **Auto-save performance** - 30s interval, but what's the save latency target?
6. **Progress tracker overhead** - Database writes on every module completion?

#### Performance Test Plan Needed

**Orchestration Performance Tests**:
- ActivityOrchestrator initialization time (<500ms for 5-module activity)
- Module transition time (<1s including state save)
- Data pipeline transformation (<50ms per module)
- Progress update latency (<200ms to Supabase)

**Multi-Module Performance Tests**:
- 3-module activity: baseline performance
- 5-module activity: acceptable degradation (<20% slower)
- 10-module activity: stress test (may show warnings)

**State Management Performance**:
- Auto-save to localStorage (<100ms)
- Supabase persistence (<500ms)
- State recovery on resume (<1s)

**Monitoring**:
- Real-time activity completion tracking
- Duration estimation accuracy trending
- Transition performance percentiles (p50, p95, p99)

**Recommendation**: Define concrete performance targets for orchestration layer before implementation.

### 3. Reliability - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (complex state management requires proven architecture)
**Target**: No student data loss, reliable resumption, graceful error handling

#### Requirements Analysis

From AC-3 (Progress Tracking):
- Save intermediate progress
- Allow resumption if interrupted
- Track time spent per module
- Show progress indicator

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Story explicitly addresses interruption/resumption
- Progress tracking is first-class requirement
- State management system planned

**Critical Gaps Identified**:
1. **State consistency not addressed** - What if ActivityOrchestrator and module state diverge?
2. **Partial save failures** - What if module data saves but progress doesn't?
3. **Concurrent activity handling** - What if student opens same activity in two tabs?
4. **State recovery validation** - How to verify recovered state is valid?
5. **Error cascading** - If one module fails, does whole activity fail?
6. **Data pipeline failures** - What if transformation fails mid-activity?

#### Required Reliability Features

**State Management Architecture**:
```
Level 1: Single Source of Truth (ActivityOrchestrator)
Level 2: Optimistic Local State (localStorage backup)
Level 3: Persistent State (Supabase)
Level 4: State Validation (on every load)
```

**Error Handling Levels**:
- **Module Error**: Isolate to single module, allow retry or skip
- **Pipeline Error**: Use default values, log for teacher review
- **Orchestrator Error**: Safe state, clear recovery path
- **Persistence Error**: Retry with exponential backoff, keep local copy

**State Consistency Rules**:
- Always save ActivityOrchestrator state BEFORE module transition
- Validate state integrity on every load (schema check)
- Detect and resolve conflicts (last-write-wins with timestamp)
- Keep audit log of state changes for debugging

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] State machine transition tests (all valid paths)
- [ ] State corruption detection and recovery
- [ ] Concurrent activity tests (same student, different tabs)
- [ ] Partial save failure tests
- [ ] Module error isolation tests
- [ ] Data pipeline fallback tests
- [ ] Auto-save retry logic tests
- [ ] State validation on resume tests

**Recommendation**: Create detailed state management ADR (ADR-004) with state machine diagram before implementation.

### 4. Maintainability - PASS

**Status**: PASS (excellent architectural separation)
**Target**: Clear component boundaries, testable orchestration logic, good documentation

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Clear component architecture (Orchestrator, Sequencer, Pipeline, Tracker)
- Each component has single responsibility
- Well-defined interfaces between components
- Integration tests mentioned in DoD
- Depends on US-001 (reuses module runtime)

**Good Practices Planned**:
- **ActivityOrchestrator**: Main controller (state machine)
- **ModuleSequencer**: Transition logic (pure functions)
- **DataPipeline**: Transformation layer (schema-driven)
- **ProgressTracker**: Analytics persistence (isolated concern)

**Areas for Enhancement**:
1. **State machine visualization** - Tool to visualize activity flow
2. **Activity configuration builder** - Prevent invalid configurations
3. **Data flow debugging** - Trace data through pipeline
4. **Activity templates library** - Known-good configurations

**Testing Coverage Plan**:
```
Unit Tests (target: 90%+ coverage):
- ModuleSequencer: ordering, transitions, validation
- DataPipeline: transformations, schema validation, defaults
- ProgressTracker: save logic, resume logic, time tracking
- ActivityOrchestrator: state machine (mocked dependencies)

Integration Tests:
- Full activity flow (3-module, 5-module)
- All module type combinations (M1→M5, M5→M14, etc.)
- Error scenarios at each transition
- Progress persistence and resumption
- Duration estimation vs actual

E2E Tests:
- Student completes full activity
- Student resumes interrupted activity
- Multiple students, concurrent activities
- Teacher previews activity flow
```

**Documentation Deliverables**:
- [ ] Activity configuration guide (schema reference)
- [ ] State management architecture (ADR-004)
- [ ] Data flow pipeline documentation
- [ ] Module compatibility matrix
- [ ] Activity templates library
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide (common issues)

**Recommendation**: Excellent foundation. Add state machine diagram to technical documentation.

## Dependency NFR Validation

**US-001 NFR Prerequisites** (Must be satisfied before US-002):

### From US-001 Must Be Working:
- ✓ Module runtime stable (no crashes)
- ✓ Error boundaries isolate module failures
- ✓ State management proven for single modules
- ✓ Performance targets met (<2s init, <50MB memory)
- ✓ Security validation working (JSON schema, XSS prevention)

### US-001 → US-002 Impact:
- If US-001 has state management issues → US-002 amplifies them 3-5x
- If US-001 has memory leaks → US-002 compounds across modules
- If US-001 error boundaries fail → US-002 loses entire activity

**Gate Check**: Verify US-001 has "PASS" or "PASS WITH MINOR ISSUES" gate status before US-002 implementation.

## Performance Budget for Multi-Module Activities

### Single Module (US-001 baseline):
- Initialization: 2s
- Memory: 50MB
- Validation: 100ms

### 3-Module Activity (US-002 target):
- Total initialization: 3s (includes orchestration overhead)
- Total memory: 120MB (modules + orchestrator state)
- Activity setup: 500ms (sequencing + validation)
- Per-transition: 1s (save + load + transform)

### 5-Module Activity (US-002 stress):
- Total initialization: 5s (acceptable degradation)
- Total memory: 180MB (warn user if >200MB)
- Activity setup: 800ms
- Per-transition: 1s (same, isolated)

### Warning Thresholds:
- >7 modules: Show "long activity" warning
- >200MB: Show "performance may be affected" warning
- >30min estimated: Show "break into multiple activities" suggestion
