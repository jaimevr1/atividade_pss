**Status**: PLANNING - NFR baseline for implementation

## Summary

- **Security**: PASS - Inherits US-001 security, minimal new attack surface
- **Performance**: CONCERNS - Problem bank size needs optimization strategy
- **Reliability**: PASS - Standard module pattern, proven error handling
- **Maintainability**: CONCERNS - Content quality depends on external review process
- **Usability**: CONCERNS - Dual competency (reading + math) creates accessibility challenges
- **Educational Quality**: CRITICAL CONCERNS - Content quality is primary risk

**Quality Score**: 65/100 (Planning baseline with content quality concerns)

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Security - PASS

**Status**: PASS (inherits US-001 foundation)
**Target**: Secure content loading, no XSS in problem text, student data protection

#### Requirements Analysis

From story and US-001 dependency:
- Problem bank loaded as JSON (similar to US-001 config)
- User input: operation button clicks only (no text input)
- No authentication at module level (system-level via US-005)
- Student responses contain no PII

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Inherits US-001 ModuleValidator (JSON schema validation)
- No user-generated content (problems are pre-created)
- No text input fields (only button clicks)
- Student responses are operation selections (not sensitive data)
- Analytics contain performance data only (no PII)

**New Attack Surfaces**:
1. **Problem text content**: Must sanitize HTML if problem text allows formatting
   - **Mitigation**: Plain text only, no HTML in problem bank
   - **Validation**: Schema enforces string type, no markup
2. **Problem bank injection**: Modified problemBank could inject malicious content
   - **Mitigation**: US-001 validation prevents unknown fields
   - **Validation**: Whitelist-only problem structure

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Validate problem bank JSON schema (enforce plain text)
- [ ] Test HTML injection attempts in problem text
- [ ] Verify student response data contains no PII
- [ ] Validate analytics output structure

**Recommendation**: Security posture is strong due to US-001 foundation. Minimal additional security work needed.

### 2. Performance - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (optimization strategy needed)
**Targets**:
- Module initialization: <2 seconds (US-001 baseline)
- Problem bank load: <1 second
- Problem rendering: <500ms per problem
- Memory usage: <50MB (US-001 baseline)
- Responsive design: 1024px+

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Inherits US-001 performance foundation
- Simple UI (text + 4 buttons)
- No heavy animations or media

**Gaps Identified**:
1. **Problem Bank Size**: 70+ problems with full metadata
   - Estimated size: 50-100KB uncompressed
   - Concern: Loading all 70 problems upfront may slow initialization
   - **Gap**: No lazy loading strategy defined
2. **Problem Rendering Performance**: No target defined
   - Each problem render involves text layout, keyword highlighting
   - **Gap**: No rendering performance target
3. **Keyword Highlighting Performance**: Dynamic highlighting could be slow
   - **Gap**: No performance target for highlighting animation
4. **Multi-Problem Session**: 10-problem session with transitions
   - **Gap**: No transition performance target

#### Performance Budget Needed

**Module Initialization** (Total: <2s per US-001):
- Problem bank fetch: <500ms (3G network)
- Problem bank parse: <100ms (JSON validation)
- Component mount: <500ms
- First problem render: <500ms
- Buffer: <400ms

**Problem Bank Optimization**:
- **Option 1: Lazy Loading** (Recommended)
  - Load 10 problems at a time (only current session)
  - Problem bank split by operation type
  - Estimated size per batch: 10-15KB
  - Benefit: Faster init, lower memory
- **Option 2: Compression**
  - Gzip problem bank JSON
  - Browser decompression
  - Estimated compressed size: 20-30KB
  - Benefit: Single request, full bank available
- **Recommendation**: Use Option 1 (lazy loading) for MVP

**Rendering Performance**:
- Problem text render: <300ms
- Keyword highlighting: <100ms (progressive, non-blocking)
- Button layout: <100ms
- Total per problem: <500ms

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Problem bank load performance (3G network)
- [ ] Bundle size analysis (problem bank JSON)
- [ ] Problem rendering performance (10 problems sequentially)
- [ ] Keyword highlighting performance (no jank)
- [ ] Memory profiling (10-problem session)
- [ ] Session transition performance (<1s per transition)

**Recommendation**: Define lazy loading strategy for problem bank before implementation.

### 3. Reliability - PASS

**Status**: PASS (standard module pattern)
**Target**: Graceful error handling, progress preservation, no data loss

#### Requirements Analysis

From story:
- AC-2: Automatic progression to next problem
- AC-3: Educational feedback on incorrect selection
- Integration with activity flow (US-002)
- No retry on wrong answers (learning opportunity, not test)

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Inherits US-001 ModuleErrorBoundary (proven error containment)
- Simple state management (current problem index, responses)
- No complex async operations (all data loaded upfront)
- No penalty for wrong answers (reduces pressure on reliability)
- Progress tracking per problem type (can resume if interrupted)

**Reliability Patterns**:
- **Error Handling**: US-001 error boundaries prevent crashes
- **State Preservation**: Student responses saved after each interaction
- **Progress Tracking**: Problem counter, responses array
- **Graceful Degradation**: If problem bank fails to load, show friendly error

**State Management**:
```javascript
{
  moduleType: "IdentificaOperação",
  currentProblemIndex: 3,
  totalProblems: 10,
  responses: [
    { problemId: "add_001", selected: "addition", correct: true, time: 12 },
    { problemId: "sub_001", selected: "multiplication", correct: false, time: 18 },
    { problemId: "mult_001", selected: "multiplication", correct: true, time: 10 }
  ],
  sessionStartedAt: "2025-10-01T14:00:00Z"
}
```

**Recovery Scenarios**:
1. **Network failure during load**: Show error, allow retry
2. **Browser refresh mid-session**: Restore state from US-001 persistence
3. **Invalid problem data**: Skip problem, log error, continue with next
4. **Rendering error**: Error boundary shows fallback, other modules unaffected

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Error boundary activation testing
- [ ] State preservation after error
- [ ] Browser refresh recovery (mid-session)
- [ ] Invalid problem data handling (graceful skip)
- [ ] Session resumption after interruption

**Recommendation**: Reliability posture is strong due to US-001 foundation. Standard testing sufficient.

### 4. Maintainability - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (external dependency on educator review)
**Target**: Clear code structure, testable components, documented content process

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Simple component architecture (module component + problem display + button handler)
- Clear separation: presentation logic vs content data
- Inherits US-001 module loading pattern
- Problem bank as JSON (easy to update, version control)

**Gaps Identified**:
1. **Content Creation Process Not Documented**
   - **Gap**: No workflow for creating/reviewing/approving problems
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent content quality, bottleneck for updates
   - **Need**: Document content creation and review process
2. **Brazilian Educator Dependency**
   - **Gap**: No process for educator engagement (timeline, deliverables, approval criteria)
   - **Impact**: Content review becomes blocker
   - **Need**: Define educator engagement model (SOW, timeline, checklist)
3. **Problem Quality Criteria Not Codified**
   - **Gap**: Subjective quality assessment ("age-appropriate", "culturally relevant")
   - **Impact**: Inconsistent reviews, rework cycles
   - **Need**: Create objective quality checklist with scoring rubric
4. **Content Versioning Strategy**
   - **Gap**: How are problem bank updates deployed without breaking activities?
   - **Impact**: Breaking changes affect existing teacher activities
   - **Need**: Problem bank versioning and migration strategy (see DATA-003 risk)

#### Content Creation Workflow Needed

**Phase 1: Creation**
1. PO creates problems using template
2. Technical validation (JSON schema, keyword presence)
3. Automated checks (vocabulary level, sentence structure)

**Phase 2: Pedagogical Review**
1. Brazilian educator reviews all problems
2. Uses quality checklist (BNCC alignment, age-appropriateness, cultural relevance)
3. Provides feedback for revision

**Phase 3: Pilot Testing**
1. Test with 10-15 students (age 9-12)
2. Measure comprehension rate, keyword recognition
3. Iterate based on student feedback

**Phase 4: Approval & Deployment**
1. Final educator sign-off
2. Problem bank added to codebase
3. Versioned deployment

**Documentation Deliverables**:

### 5. Usability - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (accessibility challenges identified)
**Target**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, age-appropriate UX, clear visual hierarchy

#### Requirements Analysis

From story:
- AC-1: Clear problem text, highlighted keywords, 4 operation buttons
- AC-2: Immediate feedback, automatic progression
- AC-3: Educational feedback on incorrect selection
- UI/UX Requirements: Atkinson Hyperlegible 18px, 48px min button height
- Accessibility: Keyboard navigation, screen readers (DoD)

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Atkinson Hyperlegible font specified (excellent for dyslexia)
- 18px minimum font size (above WCAG minimum)
- 48px button height (good touch target size)
- Subtle keyword highlighting (not distracting)
- Problem counter provides progress feedback
- No timer pressure (students can take time to read)

**Critical Usability Concerns**:

#### Concern 1: Dual Cognitive Load (Reading + Math)
**Issue**: Students must simultaneously:
1. Read and comprehend problem text (EF04LP15)
2. Identify mathematical operation (EF04MA07)

**Impact**: Students with reading difficulties may fail due to text access barriers, not math ability.

**Mitigation**:
- **Audio narration option** (text-to-speech for each problem) - RECOMMENDED
- **Simple sentence structures** (max 2 clauses per problem)
- **Keyword highlighting** to guide attention
- **Unlimited time** to read (no timer on comprehension)
- **Text complexity target**: Lexile 600-700 (4th grade reading level)

**Testing**:
- [ ] Text complexity analysis (all 70 problems)
- [ ] Text-to-speech integration testing
- [ ] Testing with students who have reading accommodations

#### Concern 2: Keyword Highlighting Effectiveness
**Issue**: Highlighting should help, not distract. Balance is critical.

**Mitigation**:
- **Subtle highlighting**: underline or bold (not bright colors)
- **Progressive highlighting**: fade in after 2 seconds (student reads first)
- **User control**: toggle highlighting on/off (accessibility setting)
- **A/B testing**: measure effectiveness with target age group

**Testing**:
- [ ] User testing with/without keyword highlighting
- [ ] Cognitive load assessment (time to read, comprehension)
- [ ] A/B testing for effectiveness (n=20+ per group)

#### Concern 3: Feedback Timing and Clarity
**Issue**: Immediate feedback + automatic progression may be too fast for slow readers.

**Current Design**:
- Student clicks operation → immediate feedback → auto-progression

**Risk**: Students may not have time to read/understand feedback before next problem.

**Mitigation**:
- **Feedback dwell time**: Show feedback for 3-5 seconds minimum before progression
- **Manual progression option**: "Next Problem" button instead of auto-advance (accessibility)
- **Feedback readability**: Simple language, 1-2 sentences max
- **Visual feedback**: Green/red color + icon (not relying on color alone, WCAG)

**Testing**:
- [ ] Feedback comprehension testing (students explain feedback in their words)
- [ ] Timing testing (measure if 3-5s is sufficient)
- [ ] Manual progression user preference testing

#### Concern 4: Screen Reader Compatibility
**Issue**: Keyword highlighting, feedback animations may not work with screen readers.

**WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements**:
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- All content available to screen readers
- Color not used as only means of conveying information
- Text alternatives for non-text content

**Mitigation**:
- **ARIA labels**: Operation buttons have descriptive labels
- **Problem text**: Fully accessible to screen readers
- **Feedback**: Announced by screen readers (role="alert")
- **Keyword highlighting**: Semantic HTML (not just CSS styling)
- **Progress indicator**: Announced on change

**Testing**:
- [ ] Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS) for complete flow
- [ ] Keyboard-only navigation testing
- [ ] ARIA label validation
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA automated audit (axe-core)

### Accessibility Test Plan

**Critical Accessibility Tests** (P0):
1. Screen reader announces all problem text clearly
2. Screen reader announces feedback on selection
3. Keyboard navigation works for all buttons (Tab, Enter)
4. Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
5. Color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1 for text)

**Important Accessibility Tests** (P1):
1. Text-to-speech integration works correctly
2. Keyword highlighting has semantic meaning (not just visual)
3. Progress indicator announced on change
4. Manual progression option available
5. Feedback timing sufficient for comprehension

**Nice-to-Have Accessibility Tests** (P2):
1. User preference settings (highlighting on/off, feedback timing)
2. High contrast mode support
3. Reduced motion mode (no keyword fade animations)

**Recommendation**: Add text-to-speech option before MVP launch. This significantly reduces accessibility barriers for students with reading difficulties.
