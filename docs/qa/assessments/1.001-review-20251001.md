## Code Quality Assessment

**Status**: NOT APPLICABLE (Planning Stage)

This story is in the planning/specification stage with no code implementation yet. This review assesses the **specification quality** and **implementability** rather than code itself.

### Specification Quality: 75/100

**Breakdown**:
- Acceptance Criteria Clarity: 70/100 (good structure, vague specifics)
- Performance Requirements: 95/100 (excellent specificity)
- Risk Assessment: 80/100 (identified but incomplete)
- Technical Architecture: 75/100 (good components, missing details)
- Definition of Done: 85/100 (comprehensive but missing items)

**Rationale**: Story provides solid foundation but needs refinement in testability and security before development begins.

---

- AC-3: ⚠ Vague ("friendly", "gracefully")

---

## Refactoring Performed

**Status**: NOT APPLICABLE (No code to refactor yet)

### Specification Improvements Recommended

**File**: `docs/stories/epic-1/us-001-sistema-runtime-modulos.md`

#### Change 1: Refine AC-1.4 - Define "Correct Initial State"

**Current**:
```markdown
- Initialize module state correctly
```

**Recommended**:
```markdown
- Initialize module state with values from config
  - BateriaRápida (M1): currentQuestion=0, answers=[], timeRemaining=config.timeLimit
  - IdentificaOperação (M5): currentScenario=0, selectedOperations=[]
  - AutoAvaliação (M14): responses={}, completedQuestions=0
```

**Why**: Specific, verifiable, testable
**How**: Provides concrete state shape for each module type

---

#### Change 2: Add Security Acceptance Criterion

**Add to story as AC-4**:
```markdown
### AC-4: Security - JSON Input Validation and Sanitization
**Given** a JSON configuration with potentially malicious content
**When** the system processes the configuration
**Then** it should:
- Sanitize all string values before rendering (XSS prevention)
- Reject configurations with unknown moduleType (whitelist only)
- Validate all numeric ranges are within bounds
- Prevent code injection via Function() or eval()
- Log security validation failures
```

**Why**: Critical security gap identified in risk assessment (SEC-001)
**How**: Makes security a first-class requirement, not an afterthought

---

#### Change 3: Add Schema Versioning to Technical Requirements

**Add to JSON Schema Example**:
```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0",
  "moduleType": "BateriaRápida",
  "config": { ... },
  "metadata": { ... }
}
```

**Add to Component Architecture**:
```markdown
### Version Compatibility
- **ModuleValidator**: Schema version checking
- **ModuleLoader**: Version negotiation and migration
- **Version Migration Strategy**: Document in ADR-001
```

**Why**: Future-proofs against breaking changes (TECH-002 risk mitigation)
**How**: Adds versioning from day 1, avoids painful migration later

---

#### Change 4: Define "Safe State" for Error Recovery

**Refine AC-3.3**:

**Current**:
```markdown
- Gracefully fallback to safe state
```

**Recommended**:
```markdown
- Gracefully fallback to safe state:
  - Display ModuleErrorFallback component
  - Show module title and friendly error message
  - Preserve other modules' functionality
  - Provide "Retry" button to re-attempt load
  - Log error details to external service
```

**Why**: "Safe state" is now concrete and testable
**How**: Specifies exact UI and behavior for error scenarios

---

#### Change 5: Add Accessibility to Acceptance Criteria

**Add to story as AC-5**:
```markdown
### AC-5: Accessibility Compliance (WCAG AA)
**Given** any rendered module
**When** a student using assistive technology interacts with it
**Then** the module should:
- Support keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
- Provide ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Announce state changes to screen readers
- Maintain focus management during dynamic updates
- Pass automated axe-core audit with no violations
```

**Why**: Accessibility is in DoD but not in acceptance criteria
**How**: Makes accessibility testable during development, not just at end

---

#### Change 6: Document State Management Strategy

**Add to Technical Requirements**:
```markdown
### State Management Architecture

**Approach**: Module-local state with runtime coordination

**Implementation**:
- Each module manages internal state via React hooks (useState)
- ModuleRuntime tracks module lifecycle (loading, ready, error, completed)
- State persistence: localStorage auto-save every 30 seconds
- State recovery: On error or refresh, restore from localStorage
- No global state store (Redux/Zustand) for MVP

**State Shape Example (BateriaRápida)**:
```typescript
interface ModuleState {
  status: 'idle' | 'running' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'error'
  progress: {
    currentQuestion: number
    totalQuestions: number
    answers: Answer[]
  }
  timing: {
    startedAt: number
    timeRemaining: number | null
  }
  lastSavedAt: number
}
```

**Rationale**: Keep it simple for MVP, avoid global state complexity
```

**Why**: Critical architectural gap affecting all development
**How**: Provides clear guidance to developers, enables consistent implementation

## Security Review

**Status**: PLANNING - Security requirements not yet implemented

### Critical Security Gaps Identified

#### Gap 1: JSON Injection and XSS Prevention

**Risk**: HIGH (SEC-001 - Score 9)
**Issue**: Teachers provide JSON configurations that are dynamically parsed and rendered. Without strict validation, malicious JSON could execute arbitrary code.

**Examples of Attack Vectors**:
```json
{
  "moduleType": "BateriaRápida",
  "config": {
    "operationType": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>",
    "customText": "<img src=x onerror='maliciousCode()'/>"
  }
}
```

**Required Mitigations**:
1. **Input Validation**:
   - Use strict JSON schema validation (Zod recommended for TypeScript)
   - Whitelist-only approach for `moduleType`
   - Validate all string fields against allowed character sets
   - Sanitize HTML special characters before rendering

2. **Content Security Policy**:
   - Add CSP headers to prevent script execution
   - `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'`
   - No inline scripts or styles

3. **Safe Rendering**:
   - Use React's automatic XSS protection (never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`)
   - Validate all config values before passing as props
   - Type-safe component interfaces (TypeScript)

**Testing Requirements**:
- Add security test suite (1.001-SEC-001 through SEC-005)
- Automated XSS payload testing
- OWASP ZAP integration in CI/CD
- Regular dependency vulnerability scanning

**Recommendation**: Create AC-4 (Security) as specified in refactoring section above.

---

#### Gap 2: Schema Version Tampering

**Risk**: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Without schema versioning, attackers could craft old schema versions to bypass new security validations.

**Mitigation**:
- Add `schemaVersion` field (required, validated)
- Reject unknown or deprecated schema versions
- Version negotiation with clear upgrade path

---

#### Gap 3: Denial of Service via Complex JSON

**Risk**: MEDIUM
**Issue**: Deeply nested JSON or extremely large arrays could cause performance degradation or crashes.

**Attack Example**:
```json
{
  "moduleType": "BateriaRápida",
  "config": {
    "nested": { "level1": { "level2": { ... (1000 levels deep) } } }
  }
}
```

**Mitigation**:
- Limit JSON parsing depth (max 10 levels)
- Limit array sizes (max 1000 elements)
- Timeout validation after 100ms
- Add resource limits to schema validation

**Testing**: Add 1.001-SEC-003 (JSON bomb test)

---

## Performance Considerations

**Status**: EXCELLENT - Clear targets defined

### Performance Targets (from Story)

| Metric | Target | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| Module initialization | <2 seconds | ✓ Clear, measurable |
| Configuration validation | <100ms | ✓ Clear, measurable |
| Memory usage per module | <50MB | ✓ Clear, measurable |
| Responsive design | 1024px+ | ✓ Clear viewport definition |

**Quality**: These are excellent performance requirements—specific, measurable, and automatable.

### Additional Performance Recommendations

#### Recommendation 1: Add Multi-Module Performance Targets

**Gap**: No performance targets for multiple simultaneous modules

**Recommended Addition to Story**:
```markdown
### Multi-Module Performance Requirements
- 3 modules simultaneously: No degradation from single module performance
- 5 modules simultaneously: Acceptable degradation (<20% slower init)
- Total memory budget: <250MB for 5 modules loaded
```

**Why**: Users will load multiple modules in activities (high probability)
**Testing**: Add 1.001-INT-012 (3 modules) and 1.001-INT-013 (5 modules stress test)

---

#### Recommendation 2: Add Bundle Size Budget

**Gap**: No bundle size constraints defined

**Recommended Addition to Story**:
```markdown
### Bundle Size Requirements
- Initial bundle (ModuleRuntime + loader): <200KB gzipped
- Per-module chunk: <100KB gzipped
- Total for 3 MVP modules: <500KB gzipped
- Code splitting by module type (lazy loading)
```

**Why**: Fast load times on slow networks
**Testing**: Add bundle size tracking to CI/CD (rollup-plugin-visualizer)

---

#### Recommendation 3: Define Network Performance Targets

**Gap**: "Graceful degradation on slow connections" is vague

**Recommended Addition to Story**:
```markdown
### Network Performance Requirements
- Fast 3G (1.6Mbps): Module loads in <5 seconds
- Slow 3G (400Kbps): Module loads in <10 seconds with progress indicator
- Offline: Clear "No connection" message, recover on reconnect
```

**Why**: Students may have poor internet connections
**Testing**: Add 1.001-E2E-005 (network throttling test)

---

## Reliability Assessment

**Status**: GOOD - Error handling explicitly addressed in AC-3

### Positive Indicators

✓ ModuleErrorBoundary component planned
✓ Error logging mentioned
✓ Graceful fallback to safe state
✓ Module isolation (one failure doesn't crash all)

### Gaps Requiring Attention

#### Gap 1: State Persistence on Error Recovery

**Issue**: AC-3 doesn't mention preserving student work when errors occur

**Impact**: Student loses progress if module crashes (DATA-001 risk)

**Recommendation**: Add to AC-3.3:
```markdown
- Preserve module state to localStorage on error
- Recover state on component remount
- Show "We recovered your work" message to student
- Auto-save every 30 seconds during normal operation
```

**Testing**: Add 1.001-INT-010 (state recovery after error test)

---

#### Gap 2: Error Logging Strategy Not Defined

**Issue**: "Log technical details" in AC-3.2 lacks specifics

**Questions**:
- Where are logs sent? (Sentry, LogRocket, custom service)
- What context is captured? (config, state, stack trace, user action)
- How do support teams access logs?
- Are logs compliant with privacy regulations (LGPD)?

**Recommendation**: Add to Technical Requirements:
```markdown
### Error Logging Strategy
- **Service**: Sentry (for error tracking) + LogRocket (session replay)
- **Context Captured**:
  - Error type and stack trace
  - Module configuration (sanitized, no PII)
  - User action leading to error
  - Browser and device info
  - Timestamp and session ID
- **Privacy**: Hash user IDs, never log personal data
- **Access**: Support team dashboard with 30-day retention
```

---

#### Gap 3: Circuit Breaker Pattern for Repeated Failures

**Issue**: No mention of handling repeated module failures

**Scenario**: If a module repeatedly fails to load (e.g., corrupted config), should the system keep trying?

**Recommendation**: Add circuit breaker logic:
```markdown
### Circuit Breaker Pattern
- After 3 consecutive failures for same module:
  - Stop auto-retry
  - Show persistent error message
  - Allow manual retry via button
  - Log as "recurring failure" for investigation
```

**Testing**: Add reliability test for repeated failures

---

## Maintainability Assessment

**Status**: EXCELLENT - Strong architectural planning

### Strengths

✓ Clear component separation (Runtime, Loader, Validator, ErrorBoundary)
✓ 90%+ test coverage required in DoD
✓ Documentation for module creators required
✓ Code review approval required
✓ Modular design supports extension

### Recommendations for Enhancement

#### Recommendation 1: Add Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Why**: Critical architectural decisions should be documented

**Required ADRs for This Story**:
- ADR-001: Module Architecture and Component Contract
- ADR-002: State Management Strategy (local vs. global)
- ADR-003: Schema Versioning Approach
- ADR-004: Error Handling Architecture

**Template**: Use standard ADR format (Context, Decision, Consequences)

---

#### Recommendation 2: Define Module Component Contract

**Issue**: Story doesn't specify the interface modules must implement

**Recommendation**: Add to Technical Requirements:
```typescript
// Module Component Contract
interface ModuleComponent {
  // Props received from ModuleRuntime
  props: {
    config: ModuleConfig // Validated configuration
    onComplete: (results: ModuleResults) => void
    onError: (error: ModuleError) => void
    initialState?: ModuleState // For recovery
  }

  // Required lifecycle methods
  initialize(): void
  cleanup(): void

  // State management
  getState(): ModuleState
  setState(state: ModuleState): void
}
```

**Why**: Ensures consistency across all module implementations
**Impact**: Future module developers have clear contract to implement

---

#### Recommendation 3: Add Storybook for Visual Component Testing

**Add to DoD**:
```markdown
- [ ] Storybook stories created for all components
- [ ] Visual regression tests configured (Chromatic)
```

**Why**: Visual testing catches UI regressions early
**Effort**: ~4 hours setup, 1 hour per component

---

## Comprehensive Quality Analysis

### Requirements Traceability: STRONG (83% full coverage)

**Assessment**: All acceptance criteria are traceable to specific test scenarios (see trace matrix). 2 partial coverage items are acceptable for MVP with clear mitigation plans.

### Risk Coverage: EXCELLENT (All risks addressed in test plan)

**Assessment**: 8 identified risks all have corresponding test scenarios and mitigation strategies. Risk-based test prioritization ensures critical issues tested first.

### Test Strategy: COMPREHENSIVE (37 test scenarios designed)

**Breakdown**:
- Unit: 14 tests (50%) - Appropriate for logic-heavy validation
- Integration: 13 tests (35%) - Good multi-component coverage
- E2E: 5 tests (13%) - Focused on critical paths
- Security: 5 tests (additional) - Addresses SEC-001 critical risk

**Assessment**: Well-balanced test pyramid, shift-left approach

### Performance Strategy: EXCELLENT (Specific, measurable targets)

**Assessment**: All performance requirements have concrete targets (<2s, <100ms, <50MB) and corresponding tests. Recommendation to add multi-module and bundle size targets.

### Security Posture: CONCERNS (Critical gaps identified)

**Assessment**: Security is addressed in risks but not in acceptance criteria. Requires AC-4 addition and security test suite before implementation.

### Accessibility Compliance: PARTIAL (DoD only, not in ACs)

**Assessment**: WCAG AA mentioned in DoD but not testable acceptance criteria. Requires AC-5 addition and accessibility test plan.

---

## Gate Status Decision

### Overall Assessment

**Gate Status**: **CONCERNS - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION WITH CLARIFICATIONS**

**Quality Score**: 70/100 (Planning Stage)

**Score Calculation**:
```
Base: 100
- Security gaps (no AC, no tests): -10
- Vague ACs (testability issues): -10
- State management undefined: -5
- Accessibility incomplete: -5
Total: 70/100
```

### Deterministic Gate Logic Applied

1. ✓ Risk assessment complete (8 risks identified)
2. ✓ All ACs have test coverage (trace matrix shows 83% full)
3. ⚠ Security NFR = CONCERNS (no AC, validation framework not chosen)
4. ⚠ Reliability NFR = CONCERNS (state persistence not detailed)
5. ⚠ Top issues: 3 medium severity (no high/critical yet - planning stage)

**Result**: CONCERNS (per NFR statuses)

### Status Reason

"Story has strong foundation with excellent performance targets and test coverage planning. Critical gaps in security AC, state management architecture, and vague testability criteria must be addressed before implementation begins. All issues are fixable in planning phase."
