**Quality Score**: 62/100 (Planning baseline)

## Detailed Assessment

### 1. Educational Quality - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (critical for first module)
**Target**: Age-appropriate, pedagogically sound, BNCC-aligned content

#### Requirements Analysis

From story and PRD:
- BNCC EF05MA03 (Division with Remainder) alignment required
- BNCC EF04MA07 (Multiplication Problems) alignment required
- Target age: 9-12 years (4th-6th grade)
- Develop mathematical fluency (core objective)
- Formative feedback integration (US-003)

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Clear BNCC competency mapping in metadata
- Division remainder handling explicitly mentioned
- Integration with feedback system planned
- Target age range specified

**Critical Gaps Identified**:

1. **Problem Generation Algorithm Not Designed** - CRITICAL
   - No detailed algorithm specification for any operation
   - Division remainder logic incomplete (generates "4 resto 3" but validation unclear)
   - Multiplication problem complexity undefined (5×8 vs 13×47)
   - Addition/subtraction algorithms missing entirely
   - Risk: Poor quality problems undermine entire educational value

2. **Pedagogical Appropriateness Undefined** - CRITICAL
   - What makes a problem "age-appropriate" for 9-year-old vs 12-year-old?
   - Difficulty progression strategy vague ("flat", "ascending", "mixed" - no detail)
   - No guidance on problem variety (abstract numbers vs word problems)
   - Cultural context mentions Real currency but no examples provided

3. **BNCC Alignment Validation Missing** - HIGH
   - EF05MA03 requires division with remainder, but how to distinguish from clean division?
   - EF04MA07 requires "problem solving", not just calculation - story has pure calculation
   - No validation that generated problems actually meet BNCC criteria
   - Mastery calculation undefined (is 80% correct = mastery?)

4. **Error Pattern Analysis Vague** - MEDIUM
   - "Track common mistake types" - what types? (remainder ignored, division order, etc.)
   - How to detect conceptual gaps vs careless errors?
   - What actions trigger based on patterns?

5. **Adaptive Difficulty Future** - LOW
   - Marked as "Future" but needed for struggling students in MVP
   - Without adaptation, frustration risk high for lower performers

#### Required Implementations

**Must Implement Before Coding**:
- **Problem Algorithm Design Session with PM** (4 hours)
  - Define exact ranges per operation per age group
  - Create sample problem sets (100+ per operation)
  - Validate with BNCC EF05MA03/EF04MA07 requirements
  - Document algorithm in story technical requirements

- **Difficulty Calibration** (2 hours)
  - Define "flat" (all problems same difficulty)
  - Define "ascending" (start easy, end hard - specific ranges)
  - Define "mixed" (random within range)
  - Specify how config.numberRange interacts with difficulty curve

- **BNCC Competency Tagging** (2 hours)
  - Create mapping table: problem characteristics → BNCC code
  - Division with remainder → EF05MA03
  - Division without remainder → ??? (different competency?)
  - Multiplication problems (not stated) → EF04MA07 or just calculation?

**Should Implement**:
- Minimum adaptive difficulty (easier problems if 3 consecutive wrong)
- Problem variety guidelines (real-world contexts when possible)
- Cultural context examples (Brazilian currency, familiar objects)

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] PM review of 100 generated problems per operation (P0)
- [ ] Statistical analysis of generated problems (range, uniqueness, distribution) (P0)
- [ ] BNCC alignment verification by pedagogy expert (P0)
- [ ] User testing with 10+ students (9-12 years) for appropriateness (P0)
- [ ] Difficulty progression testing (students complete without frustration) (P1)
- [ ] Error pattern detection validation (identify known error types) (P1)

**Recommendation**: **BLOCK implementation until PM collaboration session complete**. This is the first educational module and sets quality standard for entire product.

**Targets**:
- Problem generation: <50ms per problem ✓ (clearly defined)
- Answer validation: <100ms ✓ (clearly defined)
- Memory usage: <20MB for 100 problems ✓ (clearly defined)
- Transitions: Smooth, no jarring jumps (subjective, needs quantification)

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Clear numeric targets for generation and validation
- Memory budget defined
- Smooth transitions mentioned

**Gaps Identified**:

1. **Algorithm Complexity Undefined** - HIGH
   - Division remainder calculation could be O(n) with trial division
   - Uniqueness checking described as array scanning (O(n²) worst case for 30 problems)
   - No mention of optimization strategies
   - Risk: >50ms target missed on low-end devices

2. **Low-End Device Strategy Missing** - HIGH
   - Target minimum hardware not specified
   - School computers often older (2016-2018 Chromebooks, 4GB RAM)
   - No mention of device capability detection
   - Risk: Poor performance in actual school environment

3. **Transition Performance Undefined** - MEDIUM
   - "Smooth" is subjective, not measurable
   - Transition between problems includes: validation, feedback, state update, next problem
   - No budget for this critical UX element
   - Recommended: <1s total transition (100ms validation + 600ms animation + 300ms buffer)

4. **Memory Growth Over Session** - MEDIUM
   - 30 problems per session, but what if teacher configures 100?
   - SessionData stores all responses, error patterns, timing
   - No mention of memory cleanup or optimization
   - Risk: Memory leak over long sessions

5. **Bundle Size Impact** - LOW
   - First module added to ModuleRuntime bundle
   - No mention of code splitting for module
   - Recommended: Lazy load BateriaRápida component

#### Performance Test Plan Needed

**Unit Performance Tests**:
```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('Problem Generation Performance', () => {
  it('generates division problem in <50ms', () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    const problem = generateDivisionProblem({ min: 10, max: 100 });
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(50);
  });

  it('generates 100 problems in <5s total', () => {
    // Batch performance test
  });

  it('uses <20MB memory for 100 problems', () => {
    // Memory profiling test
  });
});
```

**Integration Performance Tests**:
- Complete 30-problem session in <15 minutes (user timing)
- Transition between problems <1s (P0)
- No memory leaks over 100 problems (P0)
- Responsive on 2018 Chromebook (4GB RAM, Celeron CPU) (P0)

**Real-World Performance Tests**:
- Test on actual school hardware
- Simulate 3G network (Supabase sync delay)
- Concurrent user load testing (30 students simultaneously)

#### Recommended Performance Budget

**Problem Generation**:
- Addition: <10ms (simplest operation)
- Subtraction: <10ms
- Multiplication: <30ms (range validation)
- Division: <50ms (remainder calculation, uniqueness check)

**Session Management**:
- State update per answer: <20ms
- Auto-save to localStorage: <50ms
- Sync to Supabase: <500ms (async, non-blocking)

**UI Performance**:
- Transition animation: 600ms (per story)
- Next problem render: <100ms
- Total transition: <1000ms (validation + animation + render)

**Memory Budget**:
- Module code: <200KB
- 30 problems: <5MB (sessionData)
- 100 problems: <20MB (stress test)

**Recommendation**: Add detailed performance tests to DoD, specify minimum hardware target.

- Font preferences included
- DoD includes "Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)"

**Critical Gaps Identified**:

1. **Screen Reader Math Notation** - CRITICAL
   - "17 ÷ 5 = ?" not readable as-is
   - Must be announced as "seventeen divided by five equals question mark"
   - MathML or ARIA labels needed
   - No implementation guidance in story

2. **Dynamic Content Announcements** - HIGH
   - Problem changes dynamically ("Automatic progression to next problem after 2 seconds")
   - Screen readers won't announce new problem without ARIA live region
   - Feedback ("✓ correct / ✗ incorrect") must be announced
   - Score updates must be announced

3. **Keyboard Focus Management** - HIGH
   - Focus must move to input field when new problem appears
   - Enter to submit must work
   - Tab order must be logical (problem → input → submit → pause)
   - Focus trap during feedback animation?

4. **Timer Accessibility** - HIGH
   - Timer creates pressure for students with processing delays
   - Story allows "null" (no timer) but default unclear
   - Visual timer must have accessible alternative
   - Recommended: Timer off by default, teacher opt-in

5. **Color Contrast and Alternatives** - MEDIUM
   - "Semantic colors (green for correct, red for incorrect)" - color only?
   - Must include shape or icon (✓ ✗) for colorblind students
   - High contrast mode mentioned but not specified
   - Progress bar must be accessible (role="progressbar", aria-valuenow)

6. **Dyslexic Font Implementation** - MEDIUM
   - "OpenDyslexic option" mentioned but no UI for preference
   - Where does student enable this? (needs persistent setting)
   - Math symbols in OpenDyslexic may look different
   - Needs user testing with dyslexic students

7. **Motor Accessibility** - LOW
   - Large input field mentioned (good)
   - Click target size for "Confirmar" button not specified (WCAG 2.5.5: 44×44px minimum)
   - No mention of voice input alternative

#### Required Accessibility Implementations

**Must Implement (WCAG AA compliance)**:
```html
<!-- Example accessible problem markup -->
<div role="region" aria-live="polite" aria-label="Math Problem">
  <p id="problem-text">
    <span aria-label="seventeen divided by five equals">17 ÷ 5 =</span>

### 4. Reliability - PASS

**Status**: PASS (good planning for session persistence and error handling)
**Target**: No data loss, graceful error recovery, consistent behavior

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Session data persistence explicitly mentioned (AC-3)
- Integration with ModuleRuntime error boundaries (US-001)
- Auto-save to Supabase for teacher analytics
- Progress tracking throughout session

**Good Practices Planned**:
- Score tracking throughout session (prevents data loss)
- Data saved for teacher analytics (persistence)
- Session completion state management
- Module integration with ModuleErrorBoundary (from US-001)

**Areas for Enhancement**:

1. **Auto-Save Frequency** - MEDIUM
   - Story saves at session end (AC-3)
   - Recommended: Auto-save every answer to localStorage
   - Sync to Supabase every 5 answers or 2 minutes
   - Prevents data loss on crash/refresh

2. **Session Recovery** - MEDIUM
   - No mention of recovery UI if interrupted
   - Recommended: "Continue where you left off?" prompt
   - Test recovery scenarios (browser crash, network loss, accidental close)

3. **Network Resilience** - LOW
   - Supabase sync requires network
   - What if student completes session offline?
   - Recommended: Queue sync requests, retry on reconnect

#### Reliability Test Plan

**Data Persistence Tests**:
- [ ] Answer data saved after each response (P0)
- [ ] Session data persists in localStorage (P0)
- [ ] Session data syncs to Supabase on completion (P0)
- [ ] Session data integrity verified (no corruption) (P0)

**Recovery Tests**:
- [ ] Browser refresh mid-session → recovery prompt (P0)
- [ ] Browser crash → data recoverable on restart (P1)
- [ ] Network loss → offline completion, sync on reconnect (P1)
- [ ] Tab close mid-session → data saved (P1)

**Error Handling Tests**:
- [ ] Invalid problem configuration → graceful error (P0)
- [ ] Supabase connection failure → local save continues (P1)
- [ ] ModuleErrorBoundary catches render errors (P0)

**Recommendation**: Add auto-save and recovery to DoD. Current design is good foundation but needs enhancement.

### 5. Usability - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (age-appropriateness needs validation, engagement unknown)
**Target**: 9-12 year olds can use independently, engaging, non-frustrating

#### Requirements Analysis

From story:
- Clear problem display (20px/700/Atkinson Hyperlegible font)
- Large input field with focus indication
- Progress indicator throughout
- Subtle feedback animations (glow, shake)
- Pause functionality
- Encouraging messages at completion

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Font choice (Atkinson Hyperlegible) designed for readability
- Large input field (good for younger students)
- Progress tracking (helps motivation)
- Pause button (student control)
- Encouraging final message (positive reinforcement)

**Critical Gaps Identified**:

1. **Age-Appropriateness Unknown** - CRITICAL
   - No user testing data for 9-12 year olds
   - Assumption: students can answer 30 problems in 15 minutes (2 per minute)
   - Risk: 9-year-olds may need 4-5 minutes per problem (struggling readers)
   - Risk: Timer pressure creates anxiety, not flow
   - **BLOCKER**: Cannot validate usability without real student testing

2. **Engagement Mechanisms Minimal** - HIGH
   - 30 identical math problems = repetitive
   - No variety in presentation ("17 ÷ 5 = ?" every time)
   - No encouragement during session (only at end)
   - No rewards or acknowledgment for persistence
   - Risk: Students disengage after 10-15 problems

3. **Error Recovery UX** - MEDIUM
   - Incorrect answer shows "correct answer" but then what?
   - Student just moves on, no chance to try again
   - No scaffolding for struggling students
   - Recommended: Optional "Try again" before showing answer

4. **Visual Design Age-Appropriateness** - MEDIUM
   - Layout wireframe is clinical, not playful
   - 9-year-olds may find it boring
   - 12-year-olds may find it babyish (if too playful)
   - Needs A/B testing with age groups

5. **Teacher Configuration Complexity** - MEDIUM
   - JSON configuration required (from US-001)
   - Teachers must understand operationType, numberRange, quantity, timeLimit, difficultyCurve
   - Risk: Teachers create broken configurations
   - Mitigation: US-009 (visual editor) is future, not MVP

#### Usability Test Plan

**User Testing Protocol** (P0 - BLOCKER):
- Recruit 10+ students (2 per age: 9, 10, 11, 12, struggling learner)
- Structured tasks:
  1. Complete 10-problem session (observe time, frustration)
  2. Use pause button (observe discovery, usage)
  3. Encounter incorrect answer (observe emotional response)
  4. Complete session (observe motivation to finish)
- Metrics:
  - Task completion rate (target >85%)
  - Time per problem (expected 20-40s)
  - Pause usage frequency
  - Frustration indicators (rapid wrong answers, verbal complaints)
  - Engagement (verbal encouragement, "one more!")
- Deliverable: Usability test report with findings, recommendations

**A/B Testing Ideas** (P2 - Post-MVP):
- Feedback style: Current vs more playful ("Legal!" vs "Muito bem!")
- Visual design: Clinical vs playful vs minimal
- Encouragement frequency: End-only vs every 10 problems
- Problem variety: Pure calculation vs word problems mixed

**Heuristic Evaluation** (P1):
- Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics applied to BateriaRápida
- Focus on: visibility of system status, user control, error prevention, consistency

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] User testing with 10+ students (9-12 years) (P0) - BLOCKER
- [ ] Completion rate >85% (P0)
- [ ] Average time per problem 20-40s (P1)
- [ ] Frustration indicators <10% of sessions (P1)
- [ ] Pause button discovery >80% (P2)
- [ ] A/B test feedback style (P2)

**Recommendation**: **BLOCK MVP release until user testing complete**. Cannot validate usability assumptions without real student data.

### 6. BNCC Compliance - CONCERNS

**Status**: CONCERNS (competency mapping needs validation)
**Target**: Accurate tracking of BNCC EF05MA03, EF04MA07 competencies

#### Requirements Analysis

From story:
- BNCC EF05MA03: Divisão com Resto (Division with Remainder)
- BNCC EF04MA07: Problemas de Multiplicação (Multiplication Problems)
- Competency progress tracking in sessionData output
- Mastery calculation (attempts, correct, mastery percentage)

#### BNCC Standards Reference

**EF05MA03** (5th grade, Mathematics):
> "Identificar e compreender regularidades em sequências numéricas compostas por múltiplos de um número natural e resolver problemas envolvendo a divisão de números naturais, com resto diferente de zero."
- Focus: Division with **non-zero remainder**
- Skill: Understanding remainder concept, not just clean division

**EF04MA07** (4th grade, Mathematics):
> "Resolver e elaborar problemas de multiplicação e divisão envolvendo números naturais e utilizando estratégias diversas, como cálculo mental, estimativa e arredondamento."
- Focus: **Problem solving** with multiplication/division, not pure calculation
- Skill: Strategy selection, mental math, estimation

#### Assessment

**Positive Indicators**:
- Story explicitly lists BNCC codes
- SessionData output includes competency tracking
- Mastery calculation included

**Critical Gaps Identified**:

1. **EF05MA03 vs Clean Division** - CRITICAL
   - EF05MA03 requires "resto diferente de zero" (non-zero remainder)
   - Story generates both clean division and division with remainder
   - How to tag: Is "20 ÷ 5 = 4" counted as EF05MA03? (it shouldn't be)
   - Risk: Inflated competency data (clean division counted as remainder understanding)

2. **EF04MA07 vs Pure Calculation** - CRITICAL
   - EF04MA07 requires "resolver e elaborar problemas" (problem solving)
   - Story shows "23 × 5 = ?" (pure calculation, not a problem)
   - True EF04MA07: "João tem 5 caixas com 23 maçãs cada. Quantas maçãs ao todo?"
   - Risk: Pure calculation does NOT meet BNCC EF04MA07 standard

3. **Mastery Calculation Undefined** - HIGH
   - Story shows: `{ attempts: 15, correct: 12, mastery: 0.80 }`
   - Is mastery = correct/attempts? (12/15 = 80%)
   - Problem: 80% on easy problems ≠ mastery
   - Difficulty weighting needed (80% on hard > 95% on easy)

4. **Error Pattern → Competency Gap Mapping** - MEDIUM
   - Story mentions: `errorPatterns: ["remainder_ignored", "division_order"]`
   - How do error patterns map to competency progress?
   - "remainder_ignored" → EF05MA03 not mastered (clear)
   - But what about partial understanding?

#### Required BNCC Implementations

**Competency Tagging Table**:
```javascript
// Problem characteristics → BNCC mapping
const BNCC_MAPPING = {
  // EF05MA03: Division with NON-ZERO remainder only
  'division_with_remainder': {
    code: 'EF05MA03',
    condition: (problem) => problem.divisor !== 0 && problem.dividend % problem.divisor !== 0,
    examples: ['17 ÷ 5', '23 ÷ 7', '31 ÷ 4']
  },

  // Clean division → different competency (not EF05MA03)
  'division_exact': {
    code: 'EF05MA06', // or appropriate code
    condition: (problem) => problem.dividend % problem.divisor === 0,
    examples: ['20 ÷ 5', '24 ÷ 6']
  },

  // EF04MA07: Multiplication PROBLEMS, not pure calculation
  'multiplication_problem': {
    code: 'EF04MA07',
    condition: (problem) => problem.hasContext === true, // word problem
    examples: ['João tem 5 caixas com 8 maçãs cada. Quantas maçãs?']
  },

  // Pure multiplication → different competency
  'multiplication_calculation': {
    code: 'EF04MA09', // or appropriate code
    condition: (problem) => problem.hasContext === false,
    examples: ['7 × 8', '12 × 5']
  }
};
```

**Mastery Calculation with Difficulty**:
```javascript
// Weighted mastery calculation
function calculateMastery(attempts) {
  const difficultyWeights = {
    easy: 0.5,    // 50% weight (EF05MA03: 10÷5)
    medium: 1.0,  // 100% weight (EF05MA03: 23÷7)
    hard: 1.5     // 150% weight (EF05MA03: 97÷13)
  };

  const totalWeight = attempts.reduce((sum, a) =>
    sum + difficultyWeights[a.difficulty], 0
  );

  const correctWeight = attempts
    .filter(a => a.correct)
    .reduce((sum, a) => sum + difficultyWeights[a.difficulty], 0);

  return correctWeight / totalWeight;
}
```
